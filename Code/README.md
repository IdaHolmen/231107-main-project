Book Nook is a replica of an online bookstore. You can add books to the cart, adjust the quantity and remove them.
It also has a badge that adjust according to how many books are in the cart. Unfortunately I did not figure out how to adjust it according to the quantity you can set for each book.

Every book has a container that can be pressed and you can learn more about each book. 

The hamburger menu on the right contains a small menu for sorting and filtering through the books. The page has to be refreshed in order to clear the filters and sorting.
